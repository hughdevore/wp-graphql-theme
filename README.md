Theme based off of Sage 9.

# To deploy to WP Engine

Since WP Engine doesn't allow root access, you currently need to compile the blade views locally and then upload them via SFTP. Lame.

- 1.) `cd wp-content/themes/wp-graphql && yarn run build:production`
- 2.) SSH into the Local by Flywheel machine
- 3.) `cd app/public`
-- 3.1.) If `blade-generate` isn't installed, install it with `wp package install git@github.com:alwaysblank/blade-generate.git`
- 4. ) `wp blade compile`, then exit.
- 5.) Copy the `dist` and `resources` folder via SFTP to `wp-content/themes/wp-graphql`
- 6.) Copy the contents of the local `uploads/cache/compiled` folder to the same remote location

## Theme setup

Edit `app/setup.php` to enable or disable theme features, setup navigation menus, post thumbnail sizes, and sidebars.

## Theme development

* Run `yarn` from the theme directory to install dependencies
* Update `resources/assets/config.json` settings:
  * `devUrl` should reflect your local development hostname
  * `publicPath` should reflect your WordPress folder structure (`/wp-content/themes/sage` for non-[Bedrock](https://roots.io/bedrock/) installs)

### Build commands

* `yarn run start` — Compile assets when file changes are made, start Browsersync session
* `yarn run build` — Compile and optimize the files in your assets directory
* `yarn run build:production` — Compile assets for production
